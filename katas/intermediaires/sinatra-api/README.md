Sinatra API
===

The goal of this kata is to make a small JSON api with the data from the file in `data.json`

You'll be using Sinatra for the HTTP

You can install the gems project with `bundle install`.

You can run the tests with `bundle exec rspec`.

You can start the server with `bundle exec rackup`.

Have fun!
