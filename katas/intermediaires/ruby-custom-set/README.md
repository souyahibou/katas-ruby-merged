# Ruby: Custom Set

Create a custom set type.

Sometimes it is necessary to define a custom data structure of some
type, like a set. In this exercise you will define your own set. How it
works internally doesn't matter, as long as it behaves like a set of
unique elements.

The tests use the Minitest testing framework. To install it run the command:

    gem install minitest

Run the tests with the `ruby` command:

    ruby custom_set_test.rb

## Resources

If you have never used Minitest, check out [Intro to TDD][tdd] tutorial from Jumpstart Lab.
